# Texture Classification Project

## Overview
This project implements texture classification using machine learning techniques to distinguish between stone, brick, and wood textures. It utilizes two feature extraction methods: Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP). The project also includes an interactive interface built with Gradio for easy testing and demonstration of the model.

## Demo


## Features
- Image classification of stone, brick, and wood textures.
- Feature extraction using GLCM and LBP methods.
- Compared based on predicition performance among multiple machine learning classifiers, including Decision Trees, SVM, and k-NN. (See `models/evaluation_reports.txt` for performance analysis.)
- Interactive Gradio interface for real-time classification.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of images of stone, brick, and wood textures.
- 100 images per category are used for training and testing.
